### Abstract

Credit Scoring is a tough subject in Banking & Financial Sector. A variety of statistical approaches are applied to estimate the expected loss and credit risk through client credit evaluation. This procedure is sensitive since incorrect scoring can overstate the risk of default and exacerbate a financial institutionâ€™s credit risk, which can lead to bankruptcy.

On the other hand, from the standpoint of data science, improving the capacity of analyzing and extracting useful information from large and complex datasets allows for the provision of insights that were before impossible or just marginally achievable.
The purpose of this work is to take a closer look at what should be addressed while adopting new high-power data analysis models and specifically machine learning. It aims to bring attention to the fact that some businesses are sensitive, and some uses of data analysis models make things more complicated for data scientists.
